# AspNetWebForms

This project was made as an example of the WebForms technology and I have used the Bootstrap Framework to improve the layout and show how it works.

I've developed this project in four tiers, let's see them:

0 - Entities tier:
Here you'll find all the entities classes about this project. So, my main objective here was just developing entities, separating them from the other tiers.

1 - Data Access tier:
This tier was made only for DAL (Data Access Layer), so, here you'll only find classes for database connection and data manipulation.

2 - Presentation tier:
Finally, the presentation layer, where the user believes that magic happens. Here youÂ´ll find all the web pages from this project and their codebihinds. You also can find the Report file (*.rdlc) that was made to show how it works in web projects.

3 - Util tier:
I've made this tier for some functionalities of the project. So, here you will see some classes responsible to Criptography (used to change user password before it is inserted in database), Generate Random strings (just for reseting user password) and Resend Email with the user password. 

I hope this project can be usefull to you.
